# The Rust Programming Language

In this repo I'm documenting my process on learning Rust by following ```The Rust Programming Language```aka ```The Rust Book```.
I don't think this repo would benefit someone besides me, but feel free to use it if you want to.

## General guidelines

- Instead of using the default command ```rustc main.rs```, I'm using ```rustc --out-dir build main.rs```to build the projects inside a build directory.
    That's in order to not commit any built binary into the repo. You can build the solutions yourself according to your OS.
